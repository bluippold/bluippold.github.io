# Spring-Loaded Liquid-Cooled Lid

---

## Project Overview

This spring-actuated lid was developed to cool high-power semiconductor devices under test, with particular focus on reliability, thermal uniformity, and repeatable contact force application. The lid integrates a copper cold plate connected to a recirculating liquid chiller, designed to dissipate heat from devices up to 600W. 

A lever mechanism actuates a spring-loaded pusher that delivers consistent clamping force through a guided alignment feature, while enabling ergonomic operation and secure engagement on the test bench.

## Design Purpose

The lid was created to support high-heat-load validation tests for semiconductor packages in a benchtop environment. It replaces more complex test enclosures with a compact system that simplifies contact, increases test throughput, and maintains repeatable pressure application.

---

## Spring-Loaded Actuation System

A dual-arm lever actuates a compression spring mechanism that applies downward force through a guided pusher. This system allows the user to preload the thermal interface material (TIM) evenly without over-tightening, reducing the risk of package damage. The mechanism locks into place for secure testing and can be quickly reset between tests.

---

## Cold Plate Thermal Architecture

The copper cold plate features machined microchannels to optimize heat transfer and minimize pressure drop. Liquid is supplied via quick-disconnect fittings connected to a recirculating chiller, enabling precise temperature control at the device interface.

---

## Device Contact Interface

The contact pusher mates with a central copper pedestal that interfaces directly with the semiconductor package. The surface is lapped for high flatness, ensuring even contact with the die and minimizing thermal resistance. The system is designed for partial-lid configurations.

---

## Thermal Control Setup

An external chiller maintains setpoint control of inlet coolant temperature. The lid is compatible with RTD or thermocouple feedback near the device surface for closed-loop validation.

---

## Mechanical Design Considerations

All mounting elements are machined from aluminum or stainless steel for durability. The base integrates guide pins for alignment to the socket housing and board stackup, ensuring proper device placement and minimizing lateral shift during engagement.

## Challenges and Performance Validation

- Achieving reliable TIM compression under high spring force  
- Maintaining thermal performance for 600W device operation  
- Balancing ergonomic lever travel with sufficient contact force  
- Ensuring coolant channel integrity under repeated cycling
