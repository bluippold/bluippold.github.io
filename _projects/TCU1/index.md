title: TCU - dual-zone
description:  This dual-zone TCU features a pneumatically-actuated cylinder coupled to a thermal head that interfaces directly with the customer's semiconductor device. The thermal head integrates thermoelectric coolers (TECs) for active heating and cooling, enabling precise temperature regulation from 0°C to 120°C. An transparent, polycarbonate housing surrounds the thermal head, forming a sealed purge chamber where dry air is introduced to prevent condensation during low-temperature operation. The system is divided into two zones: the inner CPU zone is passively cooled via a recirculating water chiller, while the outer I/O zone is actively controlled by four TECs, regulated by an external PID controller and monitored via RTD sensors for real-time feedback.
