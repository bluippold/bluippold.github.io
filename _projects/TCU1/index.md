title: TCU - 2-zone
description:  This 2-zone TCU features a pneumatically-actuated cylinder coupled to a thermal head that interfaces directly with the customer's semiconductor device. The thermal head integrates thermoelectric coolers (TECs) for active temperature control, supporting an operating range from 0°C to 120°C. An outer, polycarbonate housing surrounds the thermal head, acting as a purge chamber where dry air is introduced
