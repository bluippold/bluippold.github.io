title: TCU - dual-zone
description: "A pneumatically-actuated system designed for thermal contact with LGA packages, featuring a TEC-integrated head for 0°C to 120°C operation. There are two thermal zones: a passively-cooled CPU zone and an actively-controlled I/O zone with PID-regulated TECs and real-time RTD feedback. Includes a purge chamber to prevent condensation in low-temperature tests."
