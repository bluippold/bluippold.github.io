title: TCU - dual-zone
description: "A pneumatically-actuated thermal solution designed for LGA packages with independent control over five thermal zones: one central ASIC zone and four surrounding DDR zones. The system integrates TECs for active heating and cooling, enabling precise -20°C–120°C operation, with PID regulation and RTD feedback for each zone to support high-power semiconductor validation."
