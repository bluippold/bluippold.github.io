### Design Purpose

This five-zone TCU was developed for semiconductor device testing where precise, localized thermal control is required across both a central ASIC region and surrounding DRAM zones. Its compact design enables use in limited-space test setups while maintaining independent control across all zones.

---

### Zone Architecture

The TCU features five independently controlled thermal zones:  
- **ASIC Zone:** Center region supporting up to 170W of heat load.  
- **DRAM Zones (4x):** Surrounding zones, each supporting up to 25W.  

Each zone is thermally isolated and controlled using a dedicated TEC and RTD pair for accurate temperature regulation, with the supplied cooling water being between 14-28C in both a cold start setup and with the device under tension. 

---

### Compact Thermal Head Design

The thermal head is machined for minimal footprint, integrating internal heat spreaders and thermal isolation features between the ASIC and DRAM zones. The design balances mechanical strength with optimized heat transfer paths for efficient thermal management given the customer design constraints. System is capable of operating between -10C and 120C and reaching each limit within 60 seconds.  

---

### TEC and RTD Integration

Each zone utilizes a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) for active heating and cooling, paired with RTDs for real-time feedback. TECs are bonded to the heat spreader surfaces, while RTD placement is optimized for accurate surface temperature measurement near the device contact interface. The paired controller records all RTD readings and operates off the highest temperature one. 

---

### Mechanical Assembly and Interface

The enclosure and frame are designed for easy integration with existing gantry systems or benchtop test setups. Quick-connect water fittings and modular wiring allow for fast setup and maintenance. Each assembly is tested on an actual powered device setup to qualify its performance, including hot ramp tests, cold start testing, and thermal cycling between designed temperature range. 

---

### System Control and Wiring

Power and control signals are routed through a custom wire harness, designed for clean separation of power and signal lines. External PID controllers interface with the TECs, while an Arduino-based system enables remote control and automation. 

---

### Challenges and Design Considerations

- Achieving effective thermal isolation between closely packed zones  
- Maintaining uniform contact pressure across the device surface  
- Designing a compact assembly without compromising cooling performance  
- Routing power and signal wiring within tight spatial constraints
- Designing system to be easy to troubleshoot in case of repair/damage
