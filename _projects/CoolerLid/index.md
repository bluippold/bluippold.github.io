## Project Overview

This project involved the development of a pneumatically actuated cooling lid designed to thermally manage the I/O zone of high-power semiconductor devices during benchtop validation and reliability testing. The lid integrates a recirculating water chiller loop to maintain stable, low device temperatures during power cycling or high heat generation scenarios.

## Project Purpose

The cooling lid assembly was developed to automate device clamping and provide reliable thermal control for high-power semiconductor devices. Pneumatic actuation ensures consistent, repeatable contact forces while the recirculating cooling system maintains device temperatures well below ambient during high heat flux conditions.

---

## Thermal Architecture

The cooling system is specifically targeted to the outer I/O region of the device under test. Chilled fluid from an external recirculating water chiller is directed through internal channels machined into the lid structure, extracting heat from the device's surface and ensuring minimal thermal gradients across the interface.

---

## Pneumatic Actuation Design

The lid utilizes dual vertical pneumatic cylinders to apply a controlled downward force onto the device surface, ensuring uniform thermal contact pressure. Integrated return springs assist in smooth release and retraction, enabling efficient device cycling during testing.

---

## Fluid Loop Cooling System

Chilled water is circulated through embedded cooling channels within the lid base. Quick-connect fittings provide rapid setup and tear-down, while the internal channel routing is optimized for consistent flow distribution and effective heat removal across the entire cooling footprint.

---

## Purge Enclosure Design

To prevent condensation during sub-ambient operation, a custom purge enclosure was developed to seal the cooling lid and device region.

The enclosure consists of rigid 3D-printed ABS brackets supporting clear, static-dissipative cast acrylic windows, allowing visual inspection during operation. Dry air is injected into the sealed volume to maintain positive pressure and low humidity, protecting sensitive electronic components from moisture accumulation.

## Mechanical Integration

The cooling lid system was designed to interface precisely with custom PCB test fixtures and DUT carriers. Locating features and robust mounting allow for reliable device alignment while withstanding the mechanical loads from pneumatic clamping and thermal expansion.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- Designing pneumatic actuation for repeatable, uniform thermal contact
- Managing fluid channel routing to maximize heat extraction while minimizing flow resistance
