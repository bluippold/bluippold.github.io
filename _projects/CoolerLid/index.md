## Project Overview

This project involved the development of a pneumatically actuated cooling lid designed to thermally manage the I/O zone of high-power semiconductor devices during benchtop validation and reliability testing. The lid integrates a recirculating water chiller loop to maintain stable, low device temperatures during power cycling or high heat generation scenarios.

## Project Purpose

The lid assembly was developed to automate device clamping and thermal control for devices undergoing high-power functional validation. Pneumatic actuation simplifies device engagement while ensuring high, repeatable contact forces, and the integrated fluid cooling maintains I/O zone temperatures within specification even during extended operation.

---

## Thermal Architecture

The cooling system targets the outer I/O region of the device under test. Recirculated chilled fluid flows through embedded channels in the lid base, absorbing heat from the device and maintaining surface temperatures well below ambient. The design ensures minimal thermal gradients across the cooling surface.

---

## Pneumatic Actuation Design

Two vertical pneumatic cylinders provide downward actuation force, pressing the lid evenly onto the device surface. This ensures uniform thermal contact and eliminates the variability of manual setups. Integrated return springs aid in quick device release.

---

## Fluid Loop Cooling System

The cooling loop connects to an external recirculating water chiller. Quick-connect fittings enable easy maintenance and setup, while internal passages in the aluminum lid ensure even fluid distribution and maximize heat extraction efficiency.

---

## Purge Enclosure Design

To prevent condensation during low-temperature operation, a custom purge box was developed to enclose the cooling lid and device area. 

The purge enclosure consists of a rigid frame built from 3D-printed ABS brackets and clear, static-dissipative cast acrylic windows to allow easy visual inspection of the lid during operation, while minimizing static electricity buildup near sensitive electronics.

Dry air is introduced into the sealed enclosure through quick-connect fittings, maintaining positive pressure and keeping relative humidity low. The design balances accessibility for device swaps with robust environmental sealing for extended test cycles at sub-ambient temperatures.

## Mechanical Integration

The lid frame was designed to interface precisely with custom test boards and device carriers. Locating features and robust mounting allow for rapid device swaps while maintaining alignment and reliable sealing under pressure.
